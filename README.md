# TARGET DETECTION IN HYPERSPECTRAL IMAGES

## Keywords : Hyperspectral Imaging, Target Detection, Spectral Signature

<b>Abstract:</b>
* Hyperspectral imaging is the measurement of the energy reflected from 
surface materials in narrow and contiguous many wavelength bands. The most 
distinctive feature of hyperspectral receivers is that they have much more bands, unlike 
multispectral images. However, what makes receivers hyperspectral is not so much the 
number of bands as how narrow and how adjacent the bands are. When a hyperspectral 
data is mentioned, a three-dimensional data cube is mentioned. The first two 
dimensions show the terrestrial information, while the third dimension shows the 
spectral information. When the spectral data at a point is examined, a one-dimensional 
spectral signal is obtained. By looking at these signs, it is tried to distinguish different 
classes from each other.

* Target detection in hyperspectral images is important for many applications. Examples 
of such applications are search and rescue activities, target detection in defense 
systems, mine exploration, border security and mine detection. In this study, it is 
aimed to detect targets in two different datasets. For this, six different hyperspectral 
target detection algorithms are compared and the results are compared with ROC curves 
and show that MF, CEM and HUD algorithms can achieve high success compared to 
other algorithms.
